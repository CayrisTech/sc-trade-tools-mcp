# ‚úÖ TODO: Align with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This checklist outlines tasks needed to improve compliance with MCP (Model Context Protocol) standards and enhance overall interoperability, security, and developer usability.

---

## üìå Core MCP Compliance

- [ ] **Implement Capability Discovery**
  - Add a `describe` method to list available tools and methods for client discovery.
  - Return structured descriptions of functions/resources (names, parameters, descriptions).

- [ ] **Adopt JSON-RPC 2.0**
  - Use JSON-RPC 2.0 format for all incoming and outgoing communication.
  - Ensure responses contain standard `id`, `result`, or `error` fields.
  - Support method invocation and notification according to the spec.

- [ ] **Add `.well-known/mcp` Endpoint**
  - Implement a standardized discovery endpoint at `/.well-known/mcp`.
  - Return metadata such as server name, description, version, and available methods.

---

## üîê Security Enhancements

- [ ] **Implement Authentication**
  - Support API key-based or token-based access control.

- [ ] **Add Input Validation**
  - Sanitize and validate all inputs to protect against malformed requests or injection attacks.

- [ ] **Enforce Rate Limiting**
  - Limit request frequency to prevent abuse and ensure availability.

---

## üßæ Documentation Improvements

- [ ] **Expand README with API Reference**
  - Document all available methods, expected inputs, and returned outputs.

- [ ] **Add Example Requests and Responses**
  - Include sample curl or JSON-RPC requests with expected responses.

- [ ] **Include Client Integration Instructions**
  - Describe how to connect with Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other MCP clients.
